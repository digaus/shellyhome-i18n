# Shelly Home

<b>Shelly Home</b> is a cross platform app created by the software developer <b>Dirk Gausmann</b>. It is developed in his free time and aims to bring a better user experience to <b>Shelly</b> users

<b>Shelly Home</b> is available on <b>Android, iOS, MacOS</b> and <b>Windows</b>. You can add, manage, update and control your <b>Shelly</b> devices aswell as highly customize how and what information you want to see.<br/>The app also does work without a user account and can directly access the <b>Shelly</b> devices located in the same network. Optionally the user can connect to its <b>Shelly Cloud</b> account, to be able to control the devices from anywhere.





In order for Apple to be able to test my app as they wish I created a testsetup with multiple devices. Included are Shelly Pro 4pm, Shelly Plus 1, Shelly Plus 1pm, Shelly i3, Shelly RGBW2, Shelly Vintage and Shelly DUO RGBW GU10. There is still room left for hopefully a new Plus Dimmer and the other new Pro devices to follow!

Default this testsystem is turned off by a Shelly Plug S but can be turned on if Apple wants to test it. Each switch on the i3 directly controls one of the lights via URL http action.

This setup also helps me integrating the new NG line into my app :)
